** Add
*** DONE [[file:source-code.org][preamble/postamble]] section
*** TODO fully custom CSS
*** TODO ClojureScript execution in source code blocks
*** TODO floating preamble section
*** TODO automatically generate HTML for linked manual pages / help entries

*** TODO remove broken internal links from pages (with warning)
*** TODO make site-internal links a different color than external ones
This way each link has it's own.
*** TODO add on-hover popups for site-internal links
Have the description of the link (along with title of link) pop up when the user hovers over an internal link.
*** TODO automatically generate page descriptions
** Remove
